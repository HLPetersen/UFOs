## <u>Summary</u>
- One drawback of this webpage is it does not include a large body of data for conclusions. 
- More UFO data would provide a better basis for conclusions.
- It would be beneficial in the users could narrow down sightins by duration and having the duration be more consistent in presentation.
- The data could use some cleaning so that it is more uniform and to correct spelling errors.
